# 🎓 theGnaN – VteacH

> 🚀 *Logic-first learning, designed for the next generation.*  
> VteacH is an innovative e-learning platform that teaches programming through **pseudo-code**, **flowcharts**, and **interactive learning modules** — enabling students to think like programmers before writing real code.

---

## 📌 Overview

**VteacH** is the flagship learning platform developed by [**theGnaN**](https://thegnan.in). Built on the philosophy of *"logic before language,"* VteacH empowers students by simplifying programming into visual and logical components first — making it easier to transition into actual coding languages.

This repo serves as the **core UI and integration hub**, combining our:
- ✍️ [Pseudo-Code Editor](https://github.com/theGnaNtechHub/PseudoCodeEditor)
- 🔁 [Flowchart Evaluator](https://github.com/theGnaNtechHub/FlowChartEvaluator)
- 📘 Course-driven modules and productivity tools

## 🧩 Modules

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [`PseudoCodeEditor`](https://github.com/theGnaNtechHub/PseudoCodeEditor) | Write and simulate pseudo-code logic with real-time validation | ✅ Active |
| [`FlowChartEvaluator`](https://github.com/theGnaNtechHub/FlowChartEvaluator) | Drag-and-drop flowchart builder with logical structure checks | ✅ Active |
| `Dashboard` | Course UI, student logic workspace, productivity panel | 🛠️ In Progress |
| `Backend (FastAPI)` | APIs for auth, user progress, course data | 🛠️ Internal, under development |

## 🧠 Why VteacH?

Traditional programming education starts with syntax.  
VteacH flips that model by focusing on:
- **Logic development before language**
- **Visual learning (flowcharts, steps, patterns)**
- **Real-time simulation and correction**
- **Gamified, guided progression**

> It’s not just a platform. It’s a learning philosophy.
